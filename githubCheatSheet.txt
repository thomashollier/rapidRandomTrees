I keep forgetting this and having to relearn it everytime I dive back in so I'll document it so I can easily refresh my memory.

IN BROWSER
-1- In a browser, log into github, create a repository
-2- DO NOT click on "Initialize this repository with a README"

IN XCODE
-3- Under Source Control menu, select "Create Git Repositories..." (this will be local)
-4- Under Source Control menu, select "Commit"
-4- Go to the Source Control Navigator
-5- Right click on Remotes
-6- Add Existing Remote, if none exist, Add Remote
-7- Give it a name, put in the github address to the web repository
-8- Under Source Control menu, select "Push". Your changes will now be uploaded.
